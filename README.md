# Risotto 

> [!WARNING]
> Risotto is currently in early-stage development.

Risotto ðŸ˜‹ is a BGP updates collector that gathers BGP updates from routers via BMP and streams them into an events pipeline, such as Apache Kafka or Redpanda.

## State Management

Risotto maintains a state representing connected routers and their associated BGP peers and announced prefixes.  
This state addresses two challenges when handling BMP data:  
- **Duplicate announcements** from BMP session resets, where the router resends all active prefixes to the collector after a restart or connectivity issue.  
- **Missing withdraws** when Peer Down notifications occur or when the collector is offline, resulting in incorrect BGP state downstream.

Duplicate announcements could, in theory, be handled by the database, but less data manipulation is better. Instead, Risotto checks each incoming update against its state. If the prefix is already present, the update is discarded.

For Peer Down notifications, Risotto leverages its state to generate synthetic withdraws for the prefixes announced by the downed peer.  

To persist the state, Risotto uses Redis. The collector will fetch the current state at startup and infer any missing withdraws from the initial update flow. This ensures the database remains accurate, with the only irrecoverable events during downtime being updates announced and then withdrawn before Risotto restarts.

Conversely, Risotto can be configured to stream updates as is to the event pipeline without any state management.

## Quick Start

The easiest way to use risotto is using Docker.

* Create a `risotto.yml` configuration file

```yml
api:
  address: 0.0.0.0
  port: 3000

bmp:
  address: 0.0.0.0
  port: 4000

kafka:
  host: kafka.example.com
  port: 9092
  topic: bgp-updates

state:
  address: 0.0.0.0
  port: 6379
```

* Run your Docker container

```bash
docker run \
    -v $(PWD)/risotto.yml:/config/risotto.yml \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    -p 4000:4000 \
    ghcr.io/nxthdr/risotto:main -c /config/risotto.yml
```

An HTTP API provides the ability to retrieve the current state of the collector, including the list of connected routers and their BGP data.

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:3000
```

## Contributing

Refer to the Docker Compose [testbed](./testbed/) to try Risotto locally. The setup includes two [Bird](https://bird.network.cz/) routers that connect to Risotto, sharing updates announced between them.
